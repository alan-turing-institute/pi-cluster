# Nix Package Manager on MacOS

I currently use homebrew to manage packages. I currently have 200
packages installed, as reported by `brew list` but in fact most of
them are dependencies. `brew leaves -r` reports 30, of which the most
critical to me are `whatwhat`, `ghcup`, `highlight`, `hledger`,
`jupyterlab`, `opam`, `r`, `emacs-mac`, and perhaps `stow`. For some
reason, these don't include casks, of which I have 23 (including,
interestingly, `racket`).
