# Hardware Wishlist

These are bits of kit that we might like to order.

### Fan adapter

Status: **Ordered** by JG.

We have the [Uctronics U62453
enclosure](https://www.uctronics.com/cluster-and-rack-mount/uctronics-upgraded-complete-enclosure-raspberry-pi-cluster.html). 

It has two fans rated at 5V and 0.3A each of which requires a power
source. The new version of this enclosure comes with a couple of fan
adapters.

[Pi Hut sells
these](https://thepihut.com/products/fan-adapter-for-upgraded-complete-cluster-enclosure)
but claims they will _not_ work with the U6243, only with the new
enclosure. But [Uctronics' website claims they
do!](https://www.uctronics.com/uctronics-fan-adapter-upgraded-complete-enclosure-raspberry-pi-cluster%20case.html).
